                The Sir Thomas More <a href="https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/file/details/195" target="_blank">play
                manuscript</a> is perhaps one of the most talked about yet likewise most misunderstood
                of documents in the early modern dramatic canon. Historically, this has become know
                as the manuscript with many hands and the Hand D persona is thought to belong to that
                of playwright <a href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-life/" target="_blank"
                                 class="persName">William Shakespeare</a>. Comparing this materiality to that of
                the
                handwriting on legal documents shows this
                Hand D to truly be <span class="persName">Shakespeare</span>. This text is significant because it is the
                only surviving consecutive pages and
                fully fleshed content we have surviving in <span class="persName">Shakespeare's</span> hand. Other than
                this
                material we only have a <a
                    href="https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/highlights/shakespeares-signature" target="_blank">handful
                of signatures</a> that remain.
                This work aligns this material in a unique historical context as it speaks to the
                process of material culture but also offers a modernization to make it accessible
                for those who would not find <a
                    href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780198606536.001.0001/acref-9780198606536-e-4400"
                    target="_blank">secretary hand</a> attainable to decipher. This moment has
                the past speak in tandem with the present to better understand both the style of the
                time as well as the historical context. This is the only direct moment in <span class="persName">Shakespeare's</span>
                hand we have dramatically, and for a playwright so well known to have limited access
                to this handwritten piece neglects a major archival wonderment that this work will
                unpack and present.</p>
                <p>In this edition, I am trying to create a direct editorial comparison of the current
                    transcriptions and modernize the spelling to make it more attainable and approachable
                    to the reader. Since there is the ability to click between 3 separate instances, readers
                    can see paleographic notes as well as understand the articulation of the meaning within
                    a modern context. This will widen the access of the information for people who do
                    not understand paleography to better understand what is happening in the dramatic
                    text to glean a better sense of what the text may be able to offer them about the
                    life of historical figure <a
                            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-More-English-humanist-and-statesman"
                            target="_blank" class="persName">Sir Thomas More</a> but also drama in the early
                    modern
                    period as a whole. What readers get out of this
                    edition is access and deeper understanding. You do not need to be an archivist or
                    paleographer to appreciate this text with this particular edition. In this way, this
                    work enlightens a brand new understanding of a text that they otherwise would not
                    be able to fully understand. The meaning of the scene comes from the beauty of the
                    words and without comprehension, the manuscript will not tell that story.
                </p>
                <p>The process for editing this took a lot of time to concoct exactly what presentation
                    would most suit my intended audience to widen the sphere of accessibility. The main
                    editorial decisions came from a desire to make the unreadable readable to both the
                    common eye and the high level paleographer. For this reason, my work is divided into
                    three separate segments. The <a
                            href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001018640"
                            target="_blank" class="persName">Maunde transcription</a>, my transcription to
                    compare, and a modernized spelling and punctuation
                    version. These can be clicked back and forth to see the variability and comprehend
                    the history and changing of the text. Each transcription has a focus, the
                    <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG162680" target="_blank" class="persName">Sir
                        Edward Maunde Thompson</a> is to digitize the undigitized as a point of comparison and the
                    transcription of
                    my own work is to speak to the paleographers in the audience. The modern rendition
                    should be as accessible as possible to everyone else. I tried to make that section
                    speak to a sense of continuity, clarity, and the modern reader. I did not change wording
                    or context but I did edit spelling for clarity. With these spelling situations, the
                    text becomes so clear that any reader can perceive what is occurring in the scene.
                    Most importantly, this project is designed in such a way that asks about the universality
                    of the material at hand to best realize and understand context, situation, materiality,
                    history, and language of a very intriguing manuscript.
