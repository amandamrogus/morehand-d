            The question about the presence of William Shakespeare’s handwriting on the Sir Thomas More manuscript has
            intrigued paleographers for years. Although there is paleographic evidence that this is indeed Shakespeare’s
            handwriting from deep scrutiny and archival analysis, some are still skeptical about whether or not
            Shakespeare could have written the text. This analysis will provide a survey of the main historical research
            behind these claims that will enable a full look at this debate. As part of this analytical work, the
            paleography will read in direct comparison with Shakespeare’s authentic signatures as a point of comparison.

            To begin, I will start with the basics of what we historically know. Studies into locating and identifying
            Shakespeare’s handwriting really did not gain much traction until Edmond Malone and George Stevens began
            investigating and theorizing in the 18th century (Martin, 224). From these studies, it was stated that
            Shakespeare was right-handed (Martin, 223). All the signatures and the Sir Thomas More manuscript leaves in
            question gesture to someone who was in fact right-handed. All of these instances are also recorded in early
            modern secretary hand <span>which a young William Shakespeare would have been taught in grammar school starting at
            a very young age like five to eight years old (Jones, 37). There are six surviving authentic extent </span>
            <span>signatures (see figures 1-6) that exist with different spellings of Shakespeare’s
            name in each instance.</span>

            Out of these signatures, the final three are written from
            the hand of an ill William Shakespeare who was scripting a will on
            his deathbed and therefore have their own wobbly variation compared
            to when Shakespeare was well and healthy (Thurston, 114). These remaining more
            steady-handed signatures reveal a lot in their paleographic characters. The horizontal
            stroke above the “m” that appears in two instances seems to show a pattern rather than an
            extra stroke line. Additionally, the flourish on the “p’s” descender sustains a similar flourish
            in all of the signatures present. Also, the long magiscule “S” matches the
            Italian form of the cursive letter at the start of the surname in these signatures.
            However, what is most interesting about the signatures is the formation of the “k” in the name
            as that formulation of pen strokes and connections is very distinct.
            So although there are not more legal documents containing
            a greater quantity of his writing on the pages, paleographers can glean quite
            a bit from just looking at what the surviving Shakespeare signatures.

            Moreover, in the First Folio Heminges and Condell noted at the forefront of the volume that:
            “Shakespeare’s mind and hand went together, and what he thought he uttered with that easiness
            that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers” (Condell, 3).
            This partnered with Ben Jonson sharing, “I remember the players have often mentioned
            it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted
            out a line,” jointly illuminates the lack of blotting or error (Jonson, 34). While this is,
            as Jonson suggests, an homage to Shakespeare by his colleagues posthumously,
            knowing the seldom nature of the blotting is helpful in looking at the materiality
            of Shakespeare’s handwriting. If you look at the signatures and the pages Shakespeare
            is said to have written in Sir Thomas More manuscript, it is clear that the lack of
            blotting and mistake issue holds true. Now it is worth noting that the
