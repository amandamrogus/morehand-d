Although there is paleographic evidence that this is indeed Shakespeare’s handwriting from deep scrutiny and archival analysis, some are still skeptical about whether or not Shakespeare could have written the text. This analysis will provide a survey of the main historical research behind these claims that will enable a full look at this debate. As part of this analytical work, the paleography will read in direct comparison with Shakespeare’s authentic signatures as a point of comparison.

From these studies, it was stated that Shakespeare was right-handed (Martin, 223). All the signatures and the Sir Thomas More manuscript leaves in question gesture to someone who was in fact right-handed. All of these instances are also recorded in early modern secretary hand
