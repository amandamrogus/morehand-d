        <p>
            The question about the presence of William Shakespeare’s handwriting on the Sir Thomas More manuscript has
            intrigued paleographers for years. Although there is paleographic evidence that this is indeed Shakespeare’s
            handwriting from deep scrutiny and archival analysis, some are still skeptical about whether or not
            Shakespeare could have written the text. This analysis will provide a survey of the main historical research
            behind these claims that will enable a full look at this debate. As part of this analytical work, the
            paleography will read in direct comparison with Shakespeare’s authentic signatures as a point of comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, I will start with the basics of what we historically know. Studies into locating and identifying
            Shakespeare’s handwriting really did not gain much traction until Edmond Malone and George Stevens began
            investigating and theorizing in the 18th century (Martin, 224). From these studies, it was stated that
            Shakespeare was right-handed (Martin, 223). All the signatures and the Sir Thomas More manuscript leaves in
            question gesture to someone who was in fact right-handed. All of these instances are also recorded in early
            modern secretary hand <span>which a young William Shakespeare would have been taught in grammar school starting at
            a very young age like five to eight years old (Jones, 37). There are six surviving authentic extent </span>
            <span>signatures (see figures 1-6) that exist with different spellings of Shakespeare’s
            name in each instance.</span>

        <p>
            Out of these signatures, the final three are written from
            the hand of an ill William Shakespeare who was scripting a will on
            his deathbed and therefore have their own wobbly variation compared
            to when Shakespeare was well and healthy (Thurston, 114). These remaining more
            steady-handed signatures reveal a lot in their paleographic characters. The horizontal
            stroke above the “m” that appears in two instances seems to show a pattern rather than an
            extra stroke line. Additionally, the flourish on the “p’s” descender sustains a similar flourish
            in all of the signatures present. Also, the long magiscule “S” matches the
            Italian form of the cursive letter at the start of the surname in these signatures.
            However, what is most interesting about the signatures is the formation of the “k” in the name
            as that formulation of pen strokes and connections is very distinct.
            So although there are not more legal documents containing
            a greater quantity of his writing on the pages, paleographers can glean quite
            a bit from just looking at what the surviving Shakespeare signatures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, in the First Folio Heminges and Condell noted at the forefront of the volume that:
            “Shakespeare’s mind and hand went together, and what he thought he uttered with that easiness
            that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers” (Condell, 3).
            This partnered with Ben Jonson sharing, “I remember the players have often mentioned
            it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted
            out a line,” jointly illuminates the lack of blotting or error (Jonson, 34). While this is,
            as Jonson suggests, an homage to Shakespeare by his colleagues posthumously,
            knowing the seldom nature of the blotting is helpful in looking at the materiality
            of Shakespeare’s handwriting. If you look at the signatures and the pages Shakespeare
            is said to have written in Sir Thomas More manuscript, it is clear that the lack of
            blotting and mistake issue holds true. Now it is worth noting that the signatures would
            likely not illuminate this as much as the fuller manuscript with three leaves illustrating
            the hand, but given the parallel tendency it is nonetheless worth noting.

        <p>Looking at this writing and comparing it to what is in the Sir
            Thomas More pages (Figure 7) written by Hand D that is attributed
            to Shakespeare is an intriguing feat as well when trying to contextualize
            whether or not Shakespeare wrote these pages. The writing scrutiny around
            Shakespeare’s hand was first fully investigated by Sir Edward Maunde Thompson
            in 1916 since the paleographer shared that, “Shakespeare’s handwriting had never
            been subjected to a thorough and systematic study” (Thompson, 12). Thompson wanted
            to have a stronger claim than James Spedding had in the 1870s when
            Spedding shared that, “the handwriting found in the Sir Thomas More
            manuscript agrees with [Shakespeare’s] signature, which is a simple one,
            and written in the ordinary character of the time” (Serafin, 316). After
            studying the Sir Thomas More manuscript, Thompson shared that there are,
            “sufficient close resemblances [that] have been detected to bring the two
            handwritings together and to identify them as coming from one and the
            same hand” which means Thompson personally feels, “confident that […]
            we have indeed the handwriting of William Shakespeare” (Thompson, 41).
            Thompson made strides in navigating the Sir Thomas More manuscript in
            his scrutiny at the start of the 20th century, but there is still discrepancy
            about his findings to this date. Taking a deeper look at the five main distinctive
            paleographical formed letters will aid in seeing where
            Thompson’s claims are coming from to gain better insight into
            the debate in question about whether Shakespeare is Hand D.</p>

        <p>When initially sharing the signatures of Shakespeare, at the forefront of this section,
            notes on some of the general features were mentioned, however an overview of the main
            features that connect the two hands will be more explicitly outlined here. One telling
            sign in early modern paleography is the formation of the letter “a” in the miniscule
            (or lowercase) form since in early modern secretary hand there are two main ways to
            decipher the letter form: closed and open. Shakespeare clearly frames his miniscule
            “a” with an open top almost like a “u” and the consistency of that letter framing
            continues throughout Hand D’s pages in the Sir Thomas More manuscript in a similar
            fashion. The derivation for the early modern secretary hand letter form for the
            miniscule “a” most clearly resembles the formation of the Middle Ages Latin script
            insular half-unical form in Ireland (Bischoff, 84). Comparing the Sir Thomas More
            manuscript to the research by Bernard Bischoff in his book, Latin Paleography,
            helps to unearth where that letter form originated from (Bischoff, 85). This also
            illuminates just how far back this tendency with the lowercase “a” dates back in
            time. What is perhaps most intriguing about this is that historically the tendency
            to have the open form at the top of the “a” resembling a similar letter form from
            the Middle Ages gestures towards the solid grammar school training that Shakespeare
            had leading him towards a concreate comprehension of letter forms. The fact that
            Shakespeare would select the open framing of the “a” likely illustrates the Latin
            basis in his schooling.</p>

        <p>In addition to the framing of the letter “a,” there exists definitive similarity
            in the minim letters (“m” and “n”). The “m” and “n” both appear to share similarities
            with the Italian Luxeuil type tendency with the formation of the concavity of the
            letter forms (Bischoff, 104). When Bernhard Bischoff talks about the scriptive
            qualities of the “m” in this way in his book, there is discussion about the pace
            of writing truncating the curvature of the letters (Bischoff, 104). The Sir Thomas
            More manuscript shows a tendency towards framing these letters with a focus on speed
            rather than clarity of letter formation as most of the “m” and “n” moments are not
            fully formed which matches the essence of the lettering seen in Italian Luxeuil.
            As Thompson points out in his analysis of this letter, the “m” has a straightened
            last stroke in sequence which is distinct and common in the signatures as well
            as in the minim uses throughout the Sir Thomas More manuscript (Thompson, 23).
            Between this and the magiscule “S” in the signature (as mentioned in the discussion
            about the signatures), the tendency towards the Italian letter form present in
            these letters shows the push away from the chancery cursive letter forms which
            were also a common handwriting style in early modern England (Hamilton, 140).
            Likewise, this illuminates the positive impact that Italian handwriting had on
            the formation of the early modern secretary hand alphabet.</p>

        <p> The miniscule letters are not the only letter forms that are revealing and similar
            between the Shakespeare signatures and the Sir Thomas More manuscript, the formation
            of the magiscule (uppercase) “W” presents as one of the most distinct letter forms
            in both writing samples. Thompson shares that the framework is reminiscent of a
            German cursive capital but does not account for the ornamental dot which is not
            present in that German cursive tendency (Thompson, 25). Rather than listing it as a
            side feature, I will argue that the “W” evolved from the framing of the letter from
            the development in the late medieval era. According to Peter T. Daniels and William
            Bright’s The World’s Writing Systems book, the medieval scriptive framework for the
            flourish on the magiscule “W’ sustains the same framed sweeping movement as the
            writing seen in the late Medieval Runes table of letters (Daniels & Bright, 337).
            The sweeping gesture of the form matching the medieval formulation of the letter
            speaks to the approach stroke content that was picked up from the preceding
            handwriting system. The fact that the magiscule “W” in the Sir Thomas More
            manuscript shares the same curvature pattern as the surname in each of the
            signatures shows paleographic evidence of the hands crafting the letters
            likely being the same. </p>

        <p>Perhaps the most telling letter in all of the signature work by Shakespeare is the
            framework for the letter “r.” The miniscule form of the letter “r” in early modern
            secretary hand can be quite variable, but the similarity and clarity in the repetition
            here makes the framing of the letter quite distinct. Thompson points out in
            the Sir Thomas More manuscript that there is only one “r” that does not follow
            the pattern that is set forth in the signatures. I believe this is just a lesser
            formed miniscule “r” rather than a variation since the ill signatures of Shakespeare
            shown by the writing on his will illuminate the variation of letter forms in the
            descending fashion when fatigued. What is the most recognizable about the “r” is
            that its relation to the base stem is curved in a very articulate manner quite
            unique to Shakespeare’s handwriting, and therefore it is harder to track its
            direct line of inspiration from past handwriting systems. The flat into the
            curved nature of the miniscule letter shows some similarities to the visigothic
            miniscule forms in the Daniels and Bright examples but, even so, it is not as clear
            of an evolution as some of the other letter forms mentioned in this paper (Daniels
            & Bright, 337). What this indicates is the sincere inimitability of Shakespeare’s
            letter formation of the “r” which would prove useful in deciphering whether or not
            another manuscript was written by him. Thompson argues that it is the letters that
            are distinct that help to show the Shakespearean qualities in the Sir Thomas More
            manuscript and based on the individuality of the framework of this letter form,
            it is likely the “r” falls in this category (Thompson, 34). </p>

        <p>The last instance worth noting in this overview of the Shakespeare paleography
            debate over whether or not Shakespeare is Hand D is the early modern secretary
            hand “c” that is recurrent in the Sir Thomas More manuscript. Although not in
            Shakespeare’s signature, the crossbar identity that is in the “c” in the Sir
            Thomas More manuscript can also be seen in the framing of other letters in the
            signatures. This crossing bar formation likely comes from the way of connecting
            the humanist cursive forms as Daniels and Bright illustrate when examining the different
            formalized cursive scripts (Daniels and Bright, 323). The framing of the cross form does
            not only exist in the letter “c,” and knowing that the crossed “c” is what is used throughout
            the Sir Thomas More text in question points to a hand that will use the cross feature in
            other letters more readily. This is why when first examining the basics of the signatures
            I mentioned the letter “k” is distinct. The cross formation in that letter in
            the signatures alludes to the likelihood that the writer would use a crossed m
            iniscule “c” when writing. While this one is less definitive than the other examples,
            picking up on fluidity
            tendencies within the cross figuring can prove helpful.
            This also serves as an example of why there is still
            doubt about whether or not this is Shakespeare’s handwriting. While lots of studying and analysis has gone
            into deciphering the handwriting forms, a lack of a complete alphabet in the authentic signatures does
            unfortunately lead to some paleographic guess work.</p>
        <p>Overall, taking the time to look at the letter forms of Shakespeare’s handwriting shows not only trends and
            tendencies that can help in navigating whether or not Shakespeare wrote Sir Thomas More, but also
            understanding the history of the letter forms. Historically, the inspirations of the letters from previous
            time periods can enlighten new understanding of the paleographic choices made. Knowing Shakespeare’s
            background at grammar school and the basis for the letter forms assists in understanding why Shakespeare
            likely framed certain letters that way that he did in his signatures. Whether or not a scholar believes that
            Shakespeare wrote Sir Thomas More, this analysis illuminates through the use of paleographical analysis why
            Thompson reached the conclusions he did regarding the handwriting based on the similarities observed. By
            taking the time to look at the basis for these arguments around the manuscript, we can gain a deeper
            understanding about what is being debated and why historicizing this argument matters. </p>
        <p>In essence, by taking the time to unpack and understand the heart of the arguments surrounding Shakespeare
            debates, the basis for each side of the argument is clarified. In examining the meaning of “bard” and its
            etymology, the debate of appropriateness with regard to the terminology becomes clearer. Similarly, breaking
            apart the history behind and paleography within the Sir Thomas More manuscript helps in comprehending the
            basis for the penmanship debate. It is through historical research and avid material comprehension of texts
            that interpreting full meaning can aptly occur. These two Shakespeare debates illuminate the necessity of
            understanding the historical contexts to enable full comprehension of a textual debate or discrepancy.
            Understanding the Shakespeare history backing the arguments strengthens our understanding of the bard and
            Hand D in ways that would otherwise be overlooked.
